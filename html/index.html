    Scientists say that if any park space means less vehicles in the neighborhood, then there may be a relationship between the park space and air pollutants.

    <p> Air pollution in Brooklyn varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. Scientists from New York universities and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agree that the amount of pollutants can vary based on the amount of park space
      the area has. Increased park space could mean less vehicle traffic through a neighborhood. How can air
      pollution relate to park space?

    <p>Daniel Knopf, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences & Chemistry at Stony Brook University says, “if you have more park area and thus less air pollutant emission sources, air pollutants should decrease.</p>

    <p> Vaishali Naik, Physical Scientist at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, says “it depends one whether the increase in park space also means a reduced number of vehicles in Brooklyn.”</p>

    <p> James Booth, Professor Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the City College of New York, says, “as a general rule, if more park space means less vehicle traffic, then that will lead to an improvement in air quality.”</p>

    <p> Xinrong Ren, Physical Scientist at NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, agrees that, more park space in a city will certainly help reduce air pollutant emissions in that area (e.g., less car traffic and human activities), but in terms how much
      impact park space can have really depends on the size of park space.
      Steve DeSantis from the Bureau of Air Quality Analysis and Research at the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation says, “if we had a lot less cars, heavy construction areas, we would see better air quality. But different pollutants have
      different effects.”</p>

      <p>1. Nitrogen Oxide (NO), is from all the fuel burning of cars, and the fuel burning of apartment house buildings and private residences, according to Booth, DeSantis, and Ren.</p>

      <p>2. Fine Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) is a secondary air pollutant formed from primary air pollutants, according to Ren. Randi Walker of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation says that regional concentrations of PM 2.5 is due to a
        long range transport of the pollutant and forces outside of
        New York. For example, Walker says that particulate matter from the Tennessee Valley Authority Electricity generating facility is downwind from NY and is therefore affecting our air. He says PM 2.5 is not a good indicator of how park space
        would
        affect our air. </p>

      <p>3. Black carbon comes from the exhaust of diesel trucks, according to Booth, DeSantis, and Ren.</p>

      <p>Ren also gave an opposing argument, saying that once air pollutants are emitted into the air, “they will disperse and be transported along the wind and can be fairly mixed well over an urban area.”
        He paints an image where a city is in a box and all the air pollutants mix inside that box. “You probably won't see too much difference in air pollution in a small park and a nearby residential area if they are not too close to emission
        sources.”
